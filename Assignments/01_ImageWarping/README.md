## Implementation of Image Geometric Transformation

This repository is Chucheng Xiang's implementation of Assignment_01 of DIP. My student ID is SA24001058.

## Environment

- OS: Windows, macOS, Linux
- Python: 3.10

## Installation
Following the cloning of the repository, it is essential to verify that Python 3.10 is installed on your system and that you are currently located in the <font color="red">root directory</font> of this repository. Subsequently, you can proceed to install the necessary dependencies by executing the commands below:

1. To create virtual environment and activate it:

On Windows:
```cmd
python -m venv dip_env
dip_env\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv dip_env
source dip_env/bin/activate
```

2. To install requirements:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Transformation
To use basic transformation, run:

```cmd
python Assignments\01_ImageWarping\run_global_transform.py
```

### point guided transformation
Image warping algorithm based on MLS (Moving Least Square) can be read in [mls_algorithm](mls_algorithm.md).

To use point guided transformation, run:

```cmd
python Assignments\01_ImageWarping\run_point_transform.py
```

To use fast (using vectorization) point guided transformation, run:

```cmd
python Assignments\01_ImageWarping\run_point_transform_fast.py
```

Then, you can utilize the interface developed by Gradio, which is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:7860.

To virtualize the shape of transformed points, run:

```cmd
python Assignments\01_ImageWarping\point_virtualization.py
```

## Note

To avoid the singularity problem of transformation matrix, it is important to choose at least 3 control points for the image warping algorithm based on MLS.
